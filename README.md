Welcome to the LLVM project!

This repository contains the source code for LLVM, a toolkit for the
construction of highly optimized compilers, optimizers, and run-time
environments.

The LLVM project has multiple components. The core of the project is
itself called "LLVM". This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header
files needed to process intermediate representations and convert them into
object files. Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and
bitcode optimizer.

C-like languages use the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) frontend. This
component compiles C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ code into LLVM bitcode
-- and from there into object files, using LLVM.

Other components include:
the [libc++ C++ standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org),
the [LLD linker](https://lld.llvm.org), and more.

## Getting the Source Code and Building LLVM

Consult the
[Getting Started with LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#getting-the-source-code-and-building-llvm)
page for information on building and running LLVM.

For information on how to contribute to the LLVM project, please take a look at
the [Contributing to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html) guide.

## Getting in touch

Join the [LLVM Discourse forums](https://discourse.llvm.org/), [Discord
chat](https://discord.gg/xS7Z362),
[LLVM Office Hours](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#office-hours) or
[Regular sync-ups](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#online-sync-ups).

The LLVM project has adopted a [code of conduct](https://llvm.org/docs/CodeOfConduct.html) for
participants to all modes of communication within the project.

# MLIR-FUZZ-LTS

This repository provides long-term support (LTS) versions of MLIRSmith, MLIRod, and DESIL.
We plan to update these tools every six months or annually.
For each release, we also provide a Docker container to help users quickly get started.

The project integrates mlirsmith, mlirod, and desil into mlir/tools and includes several scripts for testing and running the tools.

The current base commit is: b83e458fe5330227581e1e65f3866ddfcd597837

## Running MLIRSmith, MLIRod, and DESIL in Docker

### Tool Functionality Test

A validation script is available under `/MLIR-FUZZ-LTS/mlir-test`.
This script checks both the correctness of generated MLIR programs and the basic functionality of the included tools.

Run: `python3 test.py`

### Running the Tools

The script `/MLIR-FUZZ-LTS/mlir-scripts/driver.sh` provides a unified driver for running the three tools.
You may also inspect the script to learn how to invoke each tool separately.

## Build From Source

You can build and run the tools manually using the following commands:

```
cd MLIR-FUZZ-LTS
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ../llvm \
-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON \
-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir\;clang\;llvm \
-DLLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;NVPTX;AMDGPU" \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON
cmake --build .
```

After building:

+ Add `build/lib` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

+ All scripts under `mlir-test` and `mlir-scripts` assume that `MLIR-FUZZ-LTS` is located at the filesystem root (`/`).

+ Follow the instructions above to run the tools.
